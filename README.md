# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The app is runing in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- This project was built to demostrate jQuery skills acquired in class by creating a simple calendar that save event for each hour of the day. 

- The project eleminates the problems of having overlapping events by making planning events simple. 

- While creating this project, I learned how to implement third party APIs such as JQuery elements, click events, form elemets, moment.js, DOM-Traversal, JWuery-Ui widgets and interactions.
